# Newspack Integrations

## A framework for syncing reader data with third-party services.

A uniform contract for syncing Newspack reader data with external systems — ESPs, CRMs, donation platforms — through bidirectional contact synchronization.

Each integration:

- Pushes contact data (Newspack → external) on reader activity events.
- Pulls contact data (external → Newspack) on a recurring schedule.
- Declares its own settings, metadata prefix, and outgoing fields.
- Exposes external fields back to Newspack for use as segmentation criteria and content gate access rules.

The framework is built on top of [Data Events](../../data-events/README.md) and uses WooCommerce [ActionScheduler](https://actionscheduler.org/) for retries and per-integration job grouping.

## File Map

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `../class-integrations.php` | Registry and orchestrator. Owns the integrations registry, enable/disable state, data event handler map, ActionScheduler group lookup, My Account endpoint registration, and the hourly health check. |
| `class-integration.php` | Abstract base class. Implements settings storage, metadata prefix, outgoing/incoming field selection, contact preparation, the health-check shell, and the data-event handler dispatcher. |
| `class-esp.php` | Built-in ESP integration. Generic adapter for Newspack Newsletters (Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, Constant Contact). |
| `class-incoming-field.php` | Value object describing an external field returned by an integration. Carries display metadata plus flags for access rules and segmentation criteria. |
| `class-contact-pull.php` | Pull pipeline. Per-integration synchronous loopback requests plus ActionScheduler-backed retries with exponential backoff. |
| `class-contact-cron.php` | Recurring cron orchestration. Stages users for pull/push and processes both queues every 5 minutes. |

The registry class is `Newspack\Reader_Activation\Integrations` (parent namespace). Classes under this folder live in `Newspack\Reader_Activation\Integrations\*`.

## Built-in Integrations

### `esp`

Syncs contacts and metadata fields with the active Newspack Newsletters service provider. Auto-registers and is enabled by default on new installs (and on legacy upgrades unless the legacy `newspack_reader_activation_sync_esp` option was explicitly disabled). Pulls custom merge fields back into Newspack for segmentation and access rules.

### `form-capture`

Registers readers from publisher-designated frontend forms built with any form tool (opt-in via the `newspack-form-capture` CSS class or configured selectors). Registered but disabled by default. It is the first capture-only built-in — neither a sync destination nor a pull source — which makes it the working reference for two patterns:

- **Capability declarations over failing gates.** `supports_push()`/`supports_pull()` return `false` (no dead outbound/inbound controls, no bearing on `has_one_syncable_integration()`), while `can_sync()` succeeds — capture-only is a declared capability, not an error state.
- **One switch for the frontend registration surface.** `supports_frontend_registration()` returns the integration's *enabled* state **and** its `get_unsupported_reason()` being null, so the page-emitted key, the endpoint acceptance, and the capture script share a single off switch — one that also closes when the site's configuration changes after enabling.

It reports itself unsupported on reCAPTCHA v2, which cannot be pre-acquired for a page-navigating form submit, and sizes its own registration rate-limit bucket via the `newspack_frontend_registration_rate_limit` filter.

---

## Registering an Integration

Integrations are registered during the `newspack_reader_activation_register_integrations` action, which fires on `init` priority 5:

```php
add_action(
    'newspack_reader_activation_register_integrations',
    function () {
        Newspack\Reader_Activation\Integrations::register( new My_Integration() );
    }
);
```

`Integrations::register()` keeps the instance in a static registry. Enabled/disabled state is persisted to the `newspack_reader_activation_enabled_integrations` option.

After registration, the integration becomes available in the publisher-facing Integrations UI and (if enabled) starts receiving sync requests.

---

## Building an Integration

An integration is a class extending `\Newspack\Reader_Activation\Integration`. The base class provides settings storage, metadata prefix, outgoing/incoming field selection, and a contact preparation pipeline. You only need to provide the parts unique to your third-party.

### Minimum implementation

```php
namespace Newspack\My_Plugin;

use Newspack\Reader_Activation\Integration;

class My_Integration extends Integration {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct(
            'my_integration',
            __( 'My Integration', 'my-plugin' ),
            __( 'Syncs reader data with My Service.', 'my-plugin' )
        );
    }

    public function register_settings_fields() {
        return [
            [
                'key'     => 'api_key',
                'type'    => 'password',
                'label'   => __( 'API Key', 'my-plugin' ),
                'default' => '',
            ],
        ];
    }

    public function can_sync( $return_errors = false ) {
        $errors = new \WP_Error();
        if ( ! $this->get_settings_field_value( 'api_key' ) ) {
            $errors->add( 'no_api_key', __( 'API key is missing.', 'my-plugin' ) );
        }
        if ( $return_errors ) {
            return $errors;
        }
        return ! $errors->has_errors();
    }

    public function push_contact_data( $contact, $context = '', $existing_contact = null ) {
        $contact = $this->prepare_contact( $contact );
        // ... push $contact to your API.
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Required methods

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `register_settings_fields()` | Return static field declarations (key, type, default at minimum). Called from the constructor. No API calls, no conditional logic based on external state. |
| `can_sync( $return_errors = false )` | Check whether the integration is configured and ready to sync. Return `bool` or `WP_Error` depending on `$return_errors`. Called before every push and pull. |
| `push_contact_data( $contact, $context, $existing_contact )` | Send contact data to the external system. Return `true` on success or `WP_Error` on failure. Failed pushes are retried via Contact Sync's ActionScheduler-backed retry mechanism. |

### Optional overrides

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `supports_push()` | Whether the integration can send contact data outbound. Defaults to `true`. Return `false` for an inbound-only integration — see [Direction capabilities and toggles](#direction-capabilities-and-toggles). |
| `supports_pull()` | Whether the integration can fetch contact data inbound. Defaults to `true`. Return `false` if `pull_contact_data()`/`get_available_incoming_fields()` are not implemented. |
| `is_set_up()` | Whether the integration is fully configured (external prerequisites **and** the integration's own settings). Defaults to `true`. Used by the Integrations UI to mark cards as ready. |
| `is_connected()` | Whether the external service prerequisite alone (provider chosen, key entered) is configured at its source. Defaults to `true`. The Integrations UI routes the card's primary action on this: not connected → `get_setup_url()`, connected but not set up → the integration's own settings view ("Finish setup"). |
| `get_unsupported_reason()` | Non-null string marks the integration as unsupported with the site's current configuration (e.g. the ESP integration while the newsletters provider is "manual"). The Integrations UI shows the string verbatim as the card's error badge and routes the primary action to `get_setup_url()`; the REST layer refuses to enable. Defaults to `null`. |
| `get_setup_url()` | Admin URL where the integration's prerequisites are configured. Defaults to empty string. |
| `test_connection()` | Lightweight live API call to verify credentials and reachability. Called as part of `health_check()`. Defaults to `true`. |
| `pull_contact_data( $user_id )` | Fetch contact data from the external system. Return `array` of `field_key => value` or `WP_Error`. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `get_available_incoming_fields()` | Return an array of `Incoming_Field` objects representing the schema available to pull. Required for any integration that supports pulling. |
| `configure_incoming_field( $field )` | Enrich an `Incoming_Field` with display metadata and promotion flags (access rule / segment criteria). Called by the framework on every constructed field. |
| `register_handlers()` | Register data event handlers (see [Data Event Handlers](#data-event-handlers)) and any WordPress hooks the integration needs. Called once per *accepted* instance after all integrations have been registered — hook here, not in the constructor, so a rejected duplicate registration never leaves live callbacks behind. |
| `supports_frontend_registration()` | Return `true` to expose this integration's registration key to the page and accept it on the frontend registration endpoint. Built-ins gate this on the enabled state so key, endpoint and script share one switch. |
| `get_registration_key()` / `validate_registration_request()` | Override to implement custom registration key schemes. Default is timing-safe HMAC-SHA256 of the integration ID and a stored per-integration seed with the site's auth salt; `rotate_registration_key()` regenerates the seed, revoking the key without touching `AUTH_SALT`. |
| `handle_logged_in_user_registration( $user, $request )` | Called when a logged-in user attempts to register again via the frontend. Use to update user data, link the account, record a new event, etc. Default is a no-op. |
| `get_my_account_menu_item()` | Return `[ 'slug' => ..., 'label' => ..., 'position' => ... ]` to add a tab to the WooCommerce My Account page. Default returns `null` (no tab). |
| `render_my_account_page( $value )` | Echo markup for the integration's My Account page. Called inside the WooCommerce account template. |
| `delete_contact( $email )` | Remove the contact identified by `$email` from the external system. Default returns a `not_implemented` WP_Error. Required only if the integration declares it can be set to `delete` mode for account-deletion handling. |

---

## Settings Fields

Settings fields are declared statically in `register_settings_fields()` and stored individually as WordPress options keyed `newspack_integration_settings_{id}_{key}`.

### Field declaration

```php
[
    'key'         => 'master_list',
    'type'        => 'select',
    'default'     => '',
    'required'    => true, // Optional. See below.
    'label'       => __( 'Master List', 'my-plugin' ),
    'description' => __( '...', 'my-plugin' ),
    'options'     => [ ... ], // Required for 'select'.
]
```

Supported `type` values: `text`, `password`, `textarea`, `number`, `checkbox`, `select`, `metadata`, `oauth`, `hidden`. The base class sanitizes values per type before persisting.

`required => true` marks a field that must have a value before the integration can be enabled from the Integrations UI. When the card's Enable action runs while a required field is empty, the UI opens a modal that collects the missing required fields, saves them, and then enables the integration in one step. Do not combine `required` with the managed field types (`oauth`, `hidden`) — the Integrations UI cannot collect those, and the settings endpoint refuses client writes for them.

`oauth` and `hidden` are **managed field types**: `Integrations::update_integration_settings()` calls `is_managed_settings_field()` and skips them, so admin clients can't overwrite them by POSTing to the settings REST endpoint. They're writable only from trusted PHP via `update_settings_field_value()`. See `Integration::MANAGED_FIELD_TYPES`.

### `oauth` field type

`oauth` renders as a Connect / Disconnect button on the integration's settings card. The stored value is the human-readable identity of the connection (account email, workspace name, etc.) — it's shown next to the Disconnect button when present, and its presence toggles the card between "Connect" and "connected" states.

Two render-time properties drive the buttons; declare them in `get_settings_config()` (not the static `register_settings_fields()`) since they typically depend on a nonce or the current user:

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `oauth_url` | Target of the **Connect** button. Usually a remote authorize URL with `redirect_uri` pointing back to your callback. |
| `disconnect_url` | Target of the **Disconnect** button. Usually a local admin URL that revokes the remote grant, clears stored tokens, and redirects back to the integrations screen. |

Typical wiring:

1. Declare the field statically with `'type' => 'oauth'` (and any siblings — `'hidden'` token fields for the access/refresh tokens, scopes, etc.).
2. Override `get_settings_config()` to attach `oauth_url` and `disconnect_url` for the current request.
3. Register an OAuth callback endpoint that exchanges the code, writes the tokens and the display identity via `update_settings_field_value()`, and redirects back to the integrations screen.
4. Implement `is_set_up()` to return `true` only when the identity field is populated, so the Integrations UI marks the card ready.

Because the field skips the REST save path, no admin client can spoof a connection by POSTing a value — every write goes through your callback.

### Reading and writing

```php
$value = $this->get_settings_field_value( 'api_key' );
$this->update_settings_field_value( 'api_key', $new_value );
```

`get_settings_field_value()` returns the field's declared `default` when no value is stored. A small legacy option map provides lazy migration for fields that were renamed from older site-wide options.

### Enriching at render time

`get_settings_fields()` is the static declaration. `get_settings_config()` is what the REST API serves to the UI — override it to add expensive data (e.g. live list options from an API) or to filter fields by the current provider/state. See `ESP::get_settings_config()` for the canonical example.

### Built-in metadata fields

Each integration automatically gets the fields for the directions it declares (see [Direction capabilities and toggles](#direction-capabilities-and-toggles) — a push-less integration gets none of the outbound rows, a pull-less one none of the inbound rows):

| Field key | Direction | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata_prefix` | outbound | `text` | String prepended to every outgoing metadata field name (default `NP_`). Stored at `newspack_integration_metadata_prefix_{id}`. Required so outgoing field names are unique on the external system. |
| `outgoing_sync_enabled` | outbound | `checkbox` | Whether outbound sync currently runs. Default `true`. Pausing it stops pushes (including account-deletion propagation) while preserving the outgoing field selection. Stored at `newspack_integration_settings_{id}_outgoing_sync_enabled`. |
| `outgoing_metadata_fields` | outbound | `metadata` | Subset of Newspack metadata fields to push. Stored at `newspack_integration_outgoing_fields_{id}`. |
| `incoming_sync_enabled` | inbound | `checkbox` | Whether inbound sync currently runs. Default `true`. Pausing it stops pulls while preserving the incoming field selection. Stored at `newspack_integration_settings_{id}_incoming_sync_enabled`. |
| `incoming_metadata_fields` | inbound | `metadata` | Subset of external fields to pull and store on the Newspack user. Stored at `newspack_integration_incoming_fields_{id}` as a `key => raw_data` map. |

### Built-in account-deletion fields

Deletion propagates through the push pipeline, so push-capable integrations also get two account-deletion settings (a push-less integration gets neither):

| Field key | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sync_account_deletion` | `checkbox` | Whether to propagate WordPress reader-account deletions to this integration. Default `true`. Stored at `newspack_integration_settings_{id}_sync_account_deletion`. Migrated lazily from the legacy `newspack_reader_activation_sync_esp_delete` option (see migration note below). |
| `account_deletion_handling` | `select` | When sync is on, choose between `delete` (call `$integration->delete_contact()`) and `flag` (push the contact with an `Account_Deleted` metadata field — a `Y-m-d H:i:s` timestamp matching peer datetime fields — plus a `Membership_Status` field set to `user-deleted` for backward compatibility). Default `'delete'` for integrations that support hard delete, otherwise `'flag'`. Stored at `newspack_integration_settings_{id}_account_deletion_handling`. Declares a `condition` on `sync_account_deletion` so the configure UI hides it when sync is off. |

**Legacy migration.** Both fields derive from the single legacy `sync_esp_delete` boolean, which was effectively three-way in behavior: `true` hard-deleted the contact, while `false` kept the contact but removed it from every list (still a deletion signal). Because *both* states propagated a deletion, a migrated site always keeps `sync_account_deletion = true`; the legacy boolean only picks the handling mode — `true → delete`, `false → flag`. Mapping legacy `false` to `flag` (rather than disabling sync) preserves the old "don't hard-delete, but still signal the deletion" posture. Sites that never set the legacy option fall through to the field defaults. See `Integration::migrate_account_deletion_setting()`.

The dispatcher lives at `Contact_Sync::handle_account_deletion()` and is called from the v1 `reader_delete_sync` data event handler. Legacy-mode sites continue to use the older `reader_deleted` handler that calls Newspack Newsletters directly.

### Conditional fields

A settings field can declare an optional `condition` so the frontend hides it when another field's current value doesn't match:

```php
[
    'key'       => 'dependent_field',
    'type'      => 'text',
    'condition' => [ 'field' => 'controlling_field', 'equals' => true ],
],
```

The configure-view in `src/wizards/audience/views/integrations/` honors this predicate. Conditions are single-level only (no nesting, no array of conditions).

## Direction capabilities and toggles

Each direction is gated twice: by a **capability** the integration declares in code, and by a **toggle** the publisher controls in the wizard.

| Method | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `supports_push()` / `supports_pull()` | *Can* this integration ever sync in that direction? Override to `false` for a direction you don't implement. |
| `is_push_enabled()` / `is_pull_enabled()` | *Should* it sync right now? `final` — capability AND toggle. Every dispatch site calls these. |

Declaring `supports_push() === false` removes the entire Outbound settings group (metadata prefix, outbound toggle, outgoing fields, both account-deletion fields), keeps the integration out of `Sync::has_one_syncable_integration()`, and skips the push path — so an inbound-only integration renders no dead outbound controls. `supports_pull() === false` does the same for the Inbound group and `Contact_Pull`.

The toggles pause a direction without discarding configuration: the stored field selections survive, so re-enabling restores them. Pausing is not retroactive — changes and deletions that occur while a direction is paused are not replayed on re-enable.

An **undeclared** toggle field reads as enabled. An integration that overrides `get_settings_fields()` without the base metadata group has no toggle to store, so the direction can only ever be paused explicitly — pre-toggle third-party integrations keep syncing. This matches the configure-view, which treats a missing toggle field as enabled.

**Scope caveat.** These toggles govern *this framework's* dispatch only. Newsletter-signup contact upserts reach the ESP through the Newspack Newsletters plugin's own channel and are unaffected by `outgoing_sync_enabled` — pausing outbound sync stops reader-data syncing, not newsletter subscriptions.

---

## Push (Outgoing Sync)

When a contact needs to be synced, the framework calls `push_contact_data()` on every active integration. The contact array is the Newspack canonical form (email, name, metadata, etc.). Implementations should call `$this->prepare_contact( $contact )` first, which, on the v1 metadata schema:

1. Filters `$contact['metadata']` to the keys enabled on this integration.
2. Renames keys using the integration's metadata prefix.
3. Preserves keys already in prefixed form if the underlying field is enabled.

On the legacy metadata schema (sites without `NEWSPACK_SYNC_METADATA_VERSION`), the metadata classes pre-filter and prefix the data by the **ESP integration's** field selection before it reaches `prepare_contact()`. The `esp` integration takes it unchanged; every other integration still narrows the set to its own enabled Outbound fields.

Matching runs on whole keys, built with the legacy pipeline's prefix (`Metadata::get_prefix()` — the prefix the data actually carries, which may differ from the integration's own). Each enabled label contributes both the key `Metadata::get_key()` produces, so keys reshaped by the `newspack_ras_metadata_key` filter still match, and the plain `prefix . label` shape. Only the raw keys in `Legacy_Metadata::UTM_RAW_KEYS` match by prefix — an enabled `Signup UTM: ` carries `Signup UTM: source` and its siblings. A label registered through `newspack_ras_metadata_keys` that happens to end in `': '` is matched exactly, so it can never carry a *different* field past the selection. Unprefixed sync-control keys (`Legacy_Metadata::SYNC_CONTROL_KEYS`: `status`, `status_if_new`) always pass through; any other unprefixed key is dropped.

An integration that has **never saved** an Outbound selection inherits the ESP integration's effective selection, so un-migrated sites keep their pre-existing payloads; an explicitly saved selection always wins, and saving with nothing checked genuinely means "push no metadata fields". Override `get_inherited_legacy_outgoing_fields()` to inherit a different set, or return `[]` from it to opt out of inheritance entirely. Two legacy-mode caveats: the upstream pre-filter runs first, so an explicit selection can only narrow the ESP's set; and once a selection is saved, inheritance only returns if the integration's `newspack_integration_outgoing_fields_*` option is deleted (NPPD-2107).

**Default posture.** Inheritance preserves behavior rather than tightening it. On a site where nobody ever saved an ESP selection, `Esp::get_enabled_outgoing_fields()` falls through to `Metadata::get_default_fields()` — every available field, including Membership Status, Total Paid and Recurring Payment — and a newly connected integration inherits exactly that. Per-integration selection is what closes that exposure, and it takes an explicit save to do so.

### Optional `$options` parameter

`Contact_Sync` may pass a fourth `$options` array to `push_contact_data()` carrying operator-driven sync scoping (currently used by the `wp newspack integrations backfill` CLI and its legacy alias `wp newspack esp sync`):

- `skip_lists` (bool) — upsert the contact without adding it to any list, so an unsubscribed contact isn't resubscribed.
- `fields` (string[]|null) — the canonical field labels the sync is scoped to (already applied to the metadata before your method is called).
- `integration_id` (string|null) — restricts the push fan-out to a single active integration. The framework acts on this key in `Contact_Sync::push_to_integrations()` before any integration is called; like the rest of `$options`, it is still visible to `push_contact_data()` overrides that declare the fourth parameter, but integrations don't need to (and shouldn't) act on it.

The abstract signature intentionally stays three-parameter (`push_contact_data( $contact, $context, $existing_contact )`). `Contact_Sync::push_to_integrations()` calls every integration with the fourth `$options` argument; PHP discards surplus positional arguments to a method that declares fewer parameters (they remain available via `func_get_args()`) — there is no warning or error, so a three-parameter implementation keeps working unchanged. Adding the fourth parameter to the *abstract* instead would be a fatal "declaration must be compatible" error for every existing three-parameter override, which is why the parameter lives only on the concrete overrides that use it. Add `$options = []` to your override only if the integration needs to react to these flags (the built-in `esp` integration reads `skip_lists`). Integrations that ignore `$options` behave exactly as before.

### When pushes are triggered

- Data event handlers registered via `register_handler()` (see below).
- Recurring cron via `Contact_Cron` (every 5 minutes for logged-in users).
- Direct calls from other Newspack subsystems via `Contact_Sync::sync_contact()`.

### Retries

Failed pushes are scheduled for retry by the upstream `Contact_Sync` class with exponential backoff via ActionScheduler. Each integration's retries are grouped under `newspack-integration-{id}` so they can be inspected and managed independently in the Activity Logs UI.

---

## Pull (Incoming Sync)

Integrations that override `pull_contact_data( $user_id )` can fetch external state back into Newspack. The returned associative array is intersected with the enabled incoming fields and persisted via `Reader_Data::update_item()` for each key.

When the provider has no contact for the reader at all, return a `WP_Error` with the code `Integration::CONTACT_NOT_FOUND_ERROR_CODE` (`ras_contact_not_found`) — it lets batch drivers count the reader as skipped rather than failed, since no re-run can make an absent contact appear. The built-in ESP integration normalizes its providers' not-found errors onto this code.

**Pulled values are additive.** A pull writes the enabled incoming fields present in the payload and never deletes reader data: a field cleared (or emptied) at the provider is simply absent from the next payload, so the previously stored value remains — including for access rules and segmentation criteria built on promoted fields. Revoking something by clearing a provider field therefore has no local effect; remove the reader's stored item instead, or gate on a field whose value changes rather than disappears.

### When pulls are triggered

The pull pipeline (`Contact_Pull` + `Contact_Cron`) runs on every logged-in pageview, throttled per user:

- If the user's last enqueue was more than 24 hours ago (`PULL_SYNC_THRESHOLD`), all enabled integrations are pulled synchronously via per-integration loopback `admin-ajax.php` requests. The request timeout defaults to 1 second per integration — anything that overruns falls back to the cron queue.
- Otherwise, the user is staged for pull on the next 5-minute batch (`Contact_Cron::CRON_INTERVAL`).

### Retries

`Contact_Pull` schedules per-integration retries with a `30s → 2min → 8min → 30min → 2h` backoff for up to 5 attempts. Retries run under the integration's ActionScheduler group (`newspack-integration-{id}`) using the hook `newspack_contact_pull_retry`.

Only transient failures (network errors, provider 5xx/429) are retried. A rejected reader-data write (`reader_data_write_failed`) is permanent — the value is unwriteable by validation, so retrying would re-fetch from the provider only to fail the same write again. Permanent failures surface as errors without scheduling a retry, and one surfacing mid-chain fails its action immediately instead of burning the remaining attempts.

### Incoming fields

`get_available_incoming_fields()` returns the schema offered by the external system. Each field is an `Incoming_Field`:

```php
$field = new Incoming_Field( 'membership_level', $raw );
$field
    ->set_name( __( 'Membership Level', 'my-plugin' ) )
    ->set_value_type( 'string' )                    // 'string' or 'boolean'.
    ->set_matching_function( 'list__in' )           // 'default', 'list__in', 'list__not_in', 'range'.
    ->set_options( [ [ 'value' => 'gold', 'label' => 'Gold' ], ... ] )
    ->set_description( __( 'Member tier from the CRM.', 'my-plugin' ) )
    ->set_is_access_rule( true )                    // Register as a content gate access rule.
    ->set_is_segment_criteria( true )               // Register as a popups segmentation criterion.
    ->set_access_rule_callback( function ( $user_id, $args ) { /* ... */ } );
```

Use `configure_incoming_field()` to enrich a field after construction — it's called on every field returned by `get_available_incoming_fields()` and again whenever stored fields are re-hydrated. This is where you set `is_access_rule`, `is_segment_criteria`, and any custom callback.

The base class also offers `get_filtered_incoming_fields()`, which hides fields whose name matches one of the integration's own outgoing prefixed keys, so publishers don't re-select fields they're already pushing.

---

## Backfill CLI

`wp newspack integrations backfill` runs an operator-driven bulk sync in either
direction, optionally scoped to a single integration:

```sh
# Re-push all readers to every active integration (same as the legacy `esp sync`).
wp newspack integrations backfill

# Pull enabled incoming fields for all readers from one integration.
wp newspack integrations backfill --direction=pull --integration=esp

# Fully catch up one integration, 500 readers per batch.
wp newspack integrations backfill --direction=both --integration=esp --batch-size=500
```

- `--direction=push|pull|both` (default `push`). Push-only flags
  (`--subscription-ids`, `--order-ids`, `--migrated-subscriptions`,
  `--skip-lists`, `--fields`) hard-error when the direction includes pull.
- Both legs honor the per-direction toggles: the push leg skips integrations
  where `is_push_enabled()` is false, and the pull leg skips those where
  `is_pull_enabled()` is false, matching every other sync dispatch site.
- A direction that includes `pull` requires at least one in-scope integration
  with inbound sync enabled *and* incoming fields selected — validated in the
  pre-flight, so a `--direction=both` run fails fast instead of completing the
  push leg first.
- `--integration=<id>` restricts the run to one active, configured integration.
  On the push side this also scopes the `--fields` pre-flight validation, checks
  that integration's own `can_sync()` and `is_push_enabled()` (rather than only
  the global "at least one syncable integration" gate), and skips ESP-specific
  guards such as the Mailchimp `--skip-lists` rejection when the target is not
  the ESP.
- A pull `--dry-run` still performs the external API reads — it only skips
  writing reader data. It does evaluate the deterministic reader-data write
  rejections, so its error tally previews what a real run would report.
- Pull failures are **not** retried via ActionScheduler (a bulk run against a
  flaky API would flood the queue): errors are tallied and logged, and the
  affected `--offset` window can be re-run. Push retry semantics are unchanged.
- Readers the provider has no contact for (`ras_contact_not_found`) are tallied
  as skipped, not as errors: a pull cannot create the missing contact, so
  re-running could never clear them and a partially-synced site would never
  exit 0.
- A run that tallies any error prints its summary as a warning and **exits 1**,
  so unattended runbooks can detect partial failure from the exit status. A
  clean run exits 0.
- Batch boundaries free the object cache and pause one second for every 100
  contacts that reached an integration, carrying the remainder forward. Pacing
  is therefore proportional to provider traffic and independent of
  `--batch-size`.
- `wp newspack esp sync` remains as a backward-compatible alias frozen to the
  push direction and its historical flag surface. It still exits 0 even when
  errors are tallied; a pre-flight failure exits 1 on both commands.

## Data Event Handlers

Integrations subscribe to [Data Events](../../data-events/README.md) by overriding `register_handlers()` and calling `$this->register_handler()`:

```php
public function register_handlers() {
    $this->register_handler( 'reader_registered', 'on_reader_registered' );
    $this->register_handler( 'woo_order_updated', 'on_woo_order_updated' );
}

public function on_reader_registered( $timestamp, $data, $client_id ) {
    // Push or transform contact data.
}
```

Each `register_handler( $action_name, $method )` call:

1. Stores the (integration, method) tuple in the registry's handler map, keyed by `static::class . '::' . $action_name`.
2. Registers a static callable `[ static::class, 'dispatch_data_event_handler' ]` with Data Events. This is intentionally serializable so ActionScheduler can persist it across requests.
3. Filters the handler's ActionScheduler group to the integration's own group via `newspack_data_events_handler_action_group`, so failures and retries are scoped per integration.

When the event fires, Data Events calls the static dispatcher, which resolves the live integration instance from the registry and invokes the original instance method. Each handler is wrapped in its own retry context — a thrown exception from a handler triggers Data Events' standard ActionScheduler retry for just that handler, without affecting other integrations.

**Constraint:** at most one instance per concrete subclass can register a handler for a given action. Late registrations for the same `(class, action)` pair overwrite earlier ones.

---

## ActionScheduler Groups

Every integration owns an ActionScheduler group named `newspack-integration-{id}`, registered with a human-readable label via `newspack_action_scheduler_group_labels`. Scheduled actions (data event handler retries, pull retries, push retries) are placed in their integration's group, which makes per-integration filtering possible in the Activity Logs UI.

Programmatic access:

```php
// All groups across integrations.
Integrations::get_all_action_groups();

// Scheduled actions for one integration.
$integration->get_scheduled_actions( [
    'status'   => 'failed',
    'per_page' => 50,
] );

// Scheduled actions for all integrations, filtered.
Integrations::get_scheduled_actions( [
    'integration_id' => 'esp',
    'status'         => 'pending',
] );

Integrations::count_scheduled_actions( [ 'integration_id' => 'esp' ] );
```

An empty `integration_id` queries every group registered by the framework.

## Health Checks

The framework schedules an hourly cron hook `newspack_integration_health_check` that walks every active integration and runs:

1. `can_sync( true )` — settings validation as a `WP_Error`.
2. `test_connection()` — live API check.

`Integration::health_check()` is `final` and returns either `true` or a `WP_Error` aggregating failures. When a failure is detected, the framework logs the error under `NEWSPACK-INTEGRATION` and fires:

```php
do_action(
    'newspack_integration_health_check_failed',
    [
        'integration_id'   => $integration->get_id(),
        'integration_name' => $integration->get_name(),
        'error'            => $result, // WP_Error
    ]
);
```

This hook is consumed by Newspack Manager to surface alerts. To disable the schedule on a specific site, add `'newspack_integration_health_check'` to the `NEWSPACK_CRON_DISABLE` constant array.

## My Account Endpoints

Integrations can add their own tab to the WooCommerce My Account page by returning a menu item from `get_my_account_menu_item()`:

```php
public function get_my_account_menu_item() {
    return [
        'slug'     => 'my-rewards',
        'label'    => __( 'My Rewards', 'my-plugin' ),
        'position' => 25, // Optional; appended if omitted.
    ];
}

public function render_my_account_page( $value ) {
    echo '<h2>' . esc_html__( 'My Rewards', 'my-plugin' ) . '</h2>';
    // ...
}
```

The registry handles rewrite endpoint registration, query var registration, menu item insertion (positional or appended, always keeping `customer-logout` last), and a one-off `flush_rewrite_rules()` whenever the set of declared slugs changes. Slug collisions resolve to first-wins; integrations registered later silently skip.

Endpoints are only registered for integrations that are currently enabled.

## Frontend Reader Registration

To allow an integration to drive frontend reader registration (e.g. a third-party signup form posting to Newspack):

1. Override `supports_frontend_registration()` to return `true`. The framework will output the integration's registration key on the page and accept it on the registration endpoint. Prefer returning the integration's *enabled* state, plus any runtime prerequisite the integration has (as the built-in `form-capture` does, which also refuses when the site is on reCAPTCHA v2), so the key, the endpoint and any frontend script share a single off switch. Checking a prerequisite only when the integration is enabled leaves a site that changes the prerequisite afterwards emitting a key nothing can use.
2. Optionally override `get_registration_key()` and `validate_registration_request()` to implement a custom key scheme (asymmetric keys, time-bounded tokens, etc.). The default is HMAC-SHA256 of the integration ID and a stored per-integration seed with the site's auth salt, compared in constant time; `rotate_registration_key()` regenerates the seed to revoke a key that is being abused (PHP-only — gate any admin surface for it on a capability check and a nonce). The pre-seed key is also accepted for one release, so pages cached before the upgrade keep validating until their TTL expires.
3. Optionally override `handle_logged_in_user_registration( $user, $request )` to react when an already-logged-in reader submits a registration request — record a new donation, link an account, fire an analytics event, etc.

Each integration's registration traffic is rate-limited per IP in its own bucket (see `Reader_Registration::get_rate_limit_bucket_for()`); integrations expecting more than the default 10/hour should size their bucket via the `newspack_frontend_registration_rate_limit` filter, as `form-capture` does.

The built-in JS client (`newspackReaderActivation.register()`) always sends the value returned by `get_registration_key()`. Custom key schemes that diverge from this default need their own client-side code to compute and submit the key.

The built-in `form-capture` integration ([class-form-capture.php](class-form-capture.php) and `src/reader-activation-form-capture/`) is the reference implementation of this section end to end: enabled-gated key emission, a capture script driving `register()`, magic-link suppression for repeat captures, and existing-reader sync scheduling.
