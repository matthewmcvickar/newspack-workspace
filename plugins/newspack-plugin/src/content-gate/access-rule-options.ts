/**
 * Helpers for the access-rule option pickers (Paid Access → "Active subscription",
 * "Institutional access"), shared by the Audience wizard's gate editor and the block
 * editor's visibility panel.
 *
 * An option's own label is just the product or institution name, which is not unique:
 * sites routinely reuse names like "Annual" or "Monthly" across legacy and current
 * product tiers. Tokens are therefore rendered as `<name> (#<id>)`, so that every token
 * identifies exactly one option, the ID is visible when verifying a gate's
 * configuration, and typing an ID narrows the suggestions — while the name stays the
 * part that reads first.
 *
 * This also keeps selection round-tripping correct. Tokens travel through
 * `FormTokenField` as plain strings, so matching them back by name alone made every
 * option sharing a name resolve together: removing one "Annual" token re-selected all of
 * them. Matching on the ID carried in the token resolves one option per token.
 *
 * The trailing ` (#<id>)` is a parsing contract as well as display copy —
 * `resolveAccessRuleOptionTokens` reads the ID back out of it — so its shape is fixed
 * rather than translatable. Only the name preceding it is publisher-facing text.
