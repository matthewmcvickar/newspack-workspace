/**
 * Reduce a subscriber's many subscription statuses to the badge(s) we show.
 *
 * Distinct statuses, ordered active-first. A cancelled subscription is hidden
 * whenever the subscriber still has any live (non-cancelled) one, since a past
 * cancellation alongside an active or on-hold plan is just noise; cancelled
 * only shows when every subscription is cancelled. Falls back to the stored
 * status when there are none on file.
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH — the "cancelled is dropped whenever a live status remains"
 * invariant is documented once, on the PHP side, in
 * Subscribers_Wizard::reduced_status(). It is re-encoded in three other places
 * that must stay in lockstep with it, each carrying a pointer back:
 * Subscribers_Wizard::customer_ids_for_statuses() (the endpoint's status
 * filter), this function (the row's status badges), and `visiblePlanEntries`
 * in SubscriberList.jsx (the Subscription column). Change one, change all four,
 * or the filter will contradict the badge it filters on.
 *
 * @param {string[]} statuses Per-subscription statuses (group and individual).
 * @param {string}   fallback Stored status to use when there are none.
 * @return {string[]} Ordered, distinct statuses to display.
