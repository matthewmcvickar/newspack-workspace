 * Shared release config factory for multi-semantic-release.

 *
 * @param {Object}  opts
 * @param {string}  opts.name        Package directory name, used for the zip asset path and label. multi-semantic-release derives git tags from the package's npm name as `<npmName>@<version>` (patched to strip the npm scope, so `@automattic/newspack-blocks` tags as `newspack-blocks@<version>`); this `name` does not affect tagging.
 * @param {string}  opts.phpFile     Main PHP file to bump the version in.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.npmPublish=false] Whether to publish to npm.
