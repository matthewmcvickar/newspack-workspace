/**
 * The `@semantic-release/git` prepare step that commits a release's version
 * bumps back to the branch — but ONLY on the stable `release` branch.
 *
 * Version and changelog stamps are authored on a single channel. The `release`
 * branch is the source of truth for CHANGELOG.md and the committed version
 * headers; the `alpha` prerelease channel still computes its version and builds
 * its zip/tag from the working-tree bump, but it does NOT commit it back to the
 * branch. This buys two things:
 *
 *   1. The committed CHANGELOG.md only ever contains stable release sections —
 *      no `-alpha.N` prerelease entries leak in as cross-channel noise.
 *      Individual `fix:` / `feat:` commits are not lost: they roll up into the
 *      next stable version's notes when promoted to `release`.
 *   2. Only one branch ever edits the version-stamp lines, so syncing `release`
 *      back into `alpha` / the default branch (post-release.sh) no longer
 *      collides on CHANGELOG.md / version headers — the recurring post-release
 *      merge conflict is eliminated at the source.
 *
 * (package.json is committed separately by
 * .github/scripts/finalize-package-versions.cjs, which release.yml likewise
 * runs only on the `release` branch.)
 *
 * Spread the result into a `prepare` array:
 *   prepare: [ ...otherSteps, ...gitCommitStep( [ phpFile, 'CHANGELOG.md' ] ) ]
 *
 * @param {string[]} assets Files to include in the release commit.
 * @return {Array} `[ gitStep ]` on the `release` branch, otherwise `[]`.
