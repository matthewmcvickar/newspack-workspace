# Post-release branch maintenance for the monorepo, run after the `release` job.
#
# After a release on the `release` branch:
#   - reset the single-serving `alpha` branch onto `release` (when the release
#     came from an alpha merge), or merge `release` into `alpha` otherwise;
#   - restore `workspace:*` for any internal workspace dep that the release
#     concretized (see restore_workspace_deps below);
#   - merge `release` back into the repository's default branch so they stay in
#     sync (then restore workspace:* there too), notifying Slack on conflict.
#
# This lives in the monorepo (not packages/scripts, which mirrors the legacy
# newspack-scripts repo and is overwritten by the daily sync) and targets the
# repo's actual default branch rather than the hard-coded `trunk` the legacy
# script used. Uses node only for the small workspace-deps rewrite (preinstalled
# on ubuntu-latest runners); otherwise pure git.

set -euo pipefail

# The default branch the legacy script called "trunk"; resolved dynamically so
# this works whether the repo's default is `main` or `trunk`.
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin | sed -n 's/.*HEAD branch: //p')
DEFAULT_BRANCH=${DEFAULT_BRANCH:-main}

# The last commit here is the automated release commit; the one before it
# carries the merge info used to decide whether the release came from alpha.

# Restore workspace:* for any internal monorepo dep
# (newspack-{scripts,components,colors,icons}) in every plugin/theme
# package.json, then commit if anything changed.
#
# Why: @semantic-release/npm's prepare step rewrites "workspace:*" to a concrete
# version in package.json before publishing to npm (npm can't consume
# workspace:*), and @semantic-release/git then commits that change to the
# `release` branch as part of the release commit. Resetting alpha onto release
# (and merging release into the default branch) carries those concrete versions
# forward, but pnpm-lock.yaml at the workspace root is keyed to workspace:* —
# the next `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` then fails with
# ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE. Restoring workspace:* here keeps both branches
# consistent with the lockfile and lets the next trunk→alpha promotion merge
# cleanly without any manual restoration dance.
#
# The commit (when needed) carries [skip ci] so it doesn't re-trigger
# release.yml — the alpha branch tip is then a chore[skip ci], same as today,
# and the team's normal promotion merge commit later (without [skip ci]) is
# what fires release.yml.
