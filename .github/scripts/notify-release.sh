# Release-success Slack notification for the monorepo, run in the `release` job
# right after multi-semantic-release publishes.
#
# A single push to `release`/`alpha` publishes a GitHub release + git tag
# (`<pkg>@<version>`) for every plugin/theme with releasable commits. This posts
# ONE summary message listing all of them, routed by branch to a workspace:
#
#   - release branch -> a8c workspace (stable),  reusing SLACK_AUTH_TOKEN.
#   - alpha   branch -> Newspack workspace (alpha), using SLACK_NEWSPACK_BOT_TOKEN.
#
# Released packages are detected by diffing the tag list captured before the
# release step ($TAGS_BEFORE_FILE) against the tags present now. The legacy
# per-repo ":ship: ... released: <url>" pings were sent by Zapier, which the
# monorepo no longer drives; this restores that notification in-repo.
#
# A failure here never fails the job: the release has already happened, so a
# Slack hiccup must not turn the run red. Set SLACK_DRY_RUN=1 to print the
# payload instead of posting (for local testing).

# A failure here must never fail the release job (the release has already
# happened). Any unhandled error under `set -e` degrades to a warning and a
# clean exit, rather than turning the run red. Intentional control-flow
# "failures" (grep -q, comm, the guarded curl) are exempt because bash does not
# trigger ERR for commands whose status is tested.
